# Mock API Example
This is an example Mock API for rapid front-end development. I walk through how to build this from scratch in [Building a JavaScript Development Environment](http://app.pluralsight.com/author/cory-house) on Pluralsight.

## Idea
- git@github.com:raidenz/mock-api-example.git
- https://github.com/json-schema-faker/json-schema-faker
- https://github.com/typicode/json-server

## Quick Start
```
npm install
npm run start-mockapi
Load http://localhost:3001/users
```

## Next Steps
Generate PUT, POST, and DELETE requests against the mock API and note that changes are saved to db.json, so they're reflected on refresh like a real database exists!
